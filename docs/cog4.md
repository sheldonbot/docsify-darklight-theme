# Chemistry Cog
This cogs has 9 commands:
- [balance](#balance)
- [borbital](#borbital)
- [combustion](#combustion)
- [compound](#compound)
- [element](#element)
- [em](#em)
- [gal-cell](#gal-cell)
- [mole](#mole)
- [pubchem](#pubchem)


## balance
The balance command can be used to balance chemical reactions. Redox reactions and other complex reactiions cannot be balanced using this method. More features are being added to solve harder balancing problems

### Syntax
If you are using original prefix(sc.):
```
    sc.balance [<reactant> + <reactant> + ... => <product> + <product> + ....]
```
If you are using your custom prefix:
```
    {prefix}balance [<reactant> + <reactant> + ... => <product> + <product> + ....]
```

## borbital
The borbital commands is used to return the energy of nth shell of a Bohr orbit which works for single electronic species like H, He+, Li2+ and so on.
The command takes an integer value which is the shell number(n)

### Syntax
If you are using original prefix(sc.):
```
    sc.borbital [n]
```
If you are using your custom prefix:
```
    {prefix}borbital [n]
```
